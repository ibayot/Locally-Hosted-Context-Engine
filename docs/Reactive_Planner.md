🚀 FINAL ARCHITECTURE: Reactive AI Code Review Engine (v2.1)Implementation Target: AI Development Agent / Senior EngineerTech Stack: Kirachon Context Engine (MCP), Auggie SDK, SQLite, GitHub Actions.1. Executive SummaryThis document defines a Reactive Orchestration Engine for context-aware code reviews. By shifting from a linear executor to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model, the system achieves sub-second context availability and deep logical validation while minimizing LLM token costs. It leverages the Kirachon Context Engine for codebase grounding and the Auggie SDK for semantic relationship mapping.2. System ArchitectureComponentResponsibilityPlan ServiceConverts a PR Diff into a DAG of review nodes.ContextProxyA caching layer for get_context_for_prompt using commit_hash keys.Auggie SDKExecutes semantic "Blast Radius" discovery for downstream impact.SQLite StoreManages plan persistence, telemetry, and comment deduplication.Guardrail LayerExecutes deterministic and heuristic checks before LLM inference.3. High-Performance Execution Model3.1 The Reactive DAGThe orchestrator dispatches independent nodes (e.g., Security, Logic, Style) in parallel.3.2 Look-Ahead Context PrefetchingLogic: While the current node is processing, the ContextProxy pre-fetches and warms the Auggie index for the next likely dependencies.Benefit: Eliminates "Context-Wait" latency.3.3 3-Tier "Optimistic" ValidationTier 1 (Deterministic): Syntax, Build, and Schema checks. (Abort if failed).Tier 2 (Heuristic): Secret scanning and Permission checks. (Block branch if failed).Tier 3 (LLM Reasoning): Deep architectural and logical review. (Parallel execution).4. Implementation Checklist for AI AgentPhase 1: Context & Cache (The Speed Layer)[ ] ContextProxy: Wrap retrieval tools in a decorator that caches by (file_path + commit_hash).[ ] Warmup Logic: Implement background indexing triggers via the Auggie SDK.Phase 2: Orchestration (The Brain)[ ] DAG Parser: Logic to turn git diff into a set of PlanSteps.[ ] Parallel Dispatcher: Support for concurrent node execution (max 3 workers).Phase 3: Persistence (The Memory)[ ] PlanStore: SQLite schema for plans, steps, and telemetry.[ ] Deduplication: Hash-based check to prevent duplicate PR comments on re-runs.5.

6. Safety & Compliance GuardrailsSecret Scrubbing: Regex-based masking of API keys/secrets before LLM egress.Token Hard-Cap: Limit each PR review to 10,000 tokens to control cost.HITL Checkpoints: Nodes of type checkpoint require a manual resume signal to proceed.
