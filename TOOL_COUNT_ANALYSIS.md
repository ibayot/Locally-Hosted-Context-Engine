# Tool Count Analysis: Context Engine MCP Server

## Executive Summary

**FINDING**: The README.md documentation is **INCORRECT**.

- **README.md claims**: 28 MCP tools
- **Actual implementation**: 29 MCP tools
- **Missing from documentation**: `execute_plan` tool

**Status**: ❌ Documentation is outdated and needs correction.

**Impact**: The promotional materials (REDDIT_POST.md and NOTEBOOKLM_PROMPT.md) created today also contain the incorrect count of 28 tools.

The MCP server registers tools in the `setupHandlers()` method (lines 184-205). Here's the complete list:

#### Core Context Tools (6 tools)
1. **`index_workspace`** - Index workspace files for semantic search
2. **`codebase_retrieval`** - PRIMARY semantic search with JSON output (programmatic use)
3. **`semantic_search`** - Semantic code search with markdown-formatted output
4. **`get_file`** - Retrieve complete file contents

15. **`visualize_plan`** - Generate visual representations (Mermaid diagrams)
16. **`execute_plan`** - Execute a plan step-by-step with code generation ⚠️ **MISSING FROM README**

#### Plan Management Tools - Phase 2 (13 tools) - Added in v1.4.0
From `planManagementTools` array in `src/mcp/tools/planManagement.ts` (lines 240-254):

17. **`save_plan`** - Save plans to persistent storage
18. **`load_plan`** - Load previously saved plans
19. **`list_plans`** - List saved plans with filtering
20. **`delete_plan`** - Delete saved plans from storage

### 3. The Missing Tool: `execute_plan`

**Tool Name**: `execute_plan`

**Location**: `src/mcp/tools/plan.ts` (lines 1055-1115)

**Registration**: `src/mcp/server.ts` line 202 (`executePlanTool`)

**Handler**: `src/mcp/server.ts` lines 283-285 (`handleExecutePlan`)

**Description** (from source code):
```
Execute steps from an implementation plan, generating code changes.

This tool orchestrates the execution of plan steps, using AI to generate
the actual code changes needed for each step.

Execution Modes:
- single_step: Execute a specific step by number (requires step_number)
- all_ready: Execute all steps whose dependencies are satisfied
- full_plan: Execute steps in dependency order (respects max_steps limit)

Output:
- Generated code changes for each step (preview by default)
- Success/failure status for each step
- Next steps that are ready to execute
- Overall progress tracking

Important:
- By default, changes are shown as preview only (apply_changes=false)
- Set apply_changes=true to actually write the generated code to files
- Use stop_on_failure=true (default) to halt on first error
```

**Parameters**:
- `plan` (required): The plan as a JSON string (from create_plan output)
- `mode` (optional): Execution mode - 'single_step', 'all_ready', or 'full_plan' (default: single_step)
- `step_number` (optional): Step number to execute (required for single_step mode)
- `apply_changes` (optional): Whether to apply changes to files (default: false - preview only)
- `max_steps` (optional): Maximum steps to execute in one call (default: 5)
- `stop_on_failure` (optional): Whether to stop on first failure (default: true)
- `additional_context` (optional): Additional context to provide to the AI for code generation

**Why It's Important**: This is a critical tool that actually generates and applies code changes based on plans. It's not just a planning tool—it's an execution tool that bridges planning and implementation.

## Why the Discrepancy Exists

### Timeline Analysis

1. **v1.4.0** introduced the planning system with 4 planning tools:
   - `create_plan`
   - `refine_plan`
   - `visualize_plan`
   - `execute_plan`

2. **README.md was updated** to document the planning tools, but `execute_plan` was accidentally omitted from the list.

3. **The header was updated** to say "28 tools available" instead of counting the actual tools.

4. **v1.4.1** added memory tools (`add_memory`, `list_memories`), which were correctly documented.

### Root Cause

The `execute_plan` tool was implemented and registered in the server, but was never added to the README.md documentation. This appears to be an oversight during the v1.4.0 release when the planning system was introduced.

## Impact Assessment

### Documentation Files Affected

1. **README.md** - Claims 28 tools, missing `execute_plan` documentation
2. **REDDIT_POST.md** (created today) - States "28 tools" in the TL;DR
3. **NOTEBOOKLM_PROMPT.md** (created today) - States "28 MCP tools" in feature highlights

### Promotional Materials Impact

The promotional materials created today contain the incorrect tool count. This needs to be corrected before publishing to:
- Reddit (r/programming, r/MachineLearning)
- Social media platforms
- Documentation sites
- Marketing materials

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Update README.md (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Action**: Add `execute_plan` tool documentation after `visualize_plan` (currently tool #13)

**Suggested Documentation**:
```markdown
14. **`execute_plan(plan, mode?, step_number?, apply_changes?, max_steps?, stop_on_failure?, additional_context?)`** - Execute plan steps with AI-powered code generation
    - `plan`: JSON string of the plan (from create_plan output)
    - `mode` (optional): 'single_step', 'all_ready', or 'full_plan' (default: single_step)
    - `step_number` (optional): Step number to execute (required for single_step mode)
    - `apply_changes` (optional): Apply changes to files (default: false - preview only)
    - `max_steps` (optional): Maximum steps to execute (default: 5)
    - `stop_on_failure` (optional): Stop on first failure (default: true)
    - `additional_context` (optional): Additional context for AI code generation
```

**Update the header**: Change "28 tools available" to "29 tools available"

**Renumber subsequent tools**: Tools 14-28 become 15-29

### 2. Update REDDIT_POST.md (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Changes needed**:
- Line 1 (title): Keep as is (doesn't mention specific count)
- Line 145: Change "28 MCP tools" to "29 MCP tools"
- Line 158: Change "TL;DR" from "28 tools" to "29 tools"

### 3. Update NOTEBOOKLM_PROMPT.md (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Changes needed**:
- Line 21: Change "28 tools" to "29 tools"
- Line 52: Change "28 MCP Tools" to "29 MCP Tools"
- Add `execute_plan` to the feature descriptions

### 4. Verify Other Documentation Files (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

Check these files for tool count references:
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- RELEASE_NOTES_v1.4.0.md (if it exists)
- RELEASE_NOTES_v1.5.0.md (if it exists)

### 5. Add to Planning Workflow Examples (LOW PRIORITY)

The README.md has a "Planning Workflow" section (lines 171-224) that shows examples of using planning tools. Consider adding an example of using `execute_plan` in this section.

---

## Correct Tool Count Summary

**Total Tools**: **29**

**Breakdown**:
- Core Context Tools: 6
- Index Management Tools: 4
- Memory Tools: 2
- Planning Tools (Phase 1): 4 (including `execute_plan`)
- Plan Management Tools (Phase 2): 13

**All 29 tools are**:
1. Fully implemented ✅
2. Registered in the MCP server ✅
3. Have working handlers ✅
4. Are production-ready ✅

**Documentation status**:
- 28 tools are documented ✅
- 1 tool (`execute_plan`) is missing from documentation ❌

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Immediate**: Update README.md to add `execute_plan` and change count to 29
2. ✅ **Immediate**: Update REDDIT_POST.md and NOTEBOOKLM_PROMPT.md with correct count
3. ⏳ **Soon**: Verify and update other documentation files
4. ⏳ **Soon**: Add `execute_plan` usage examples to the Planning Workflow section
5. ⏳ **Future**: Consider adding a tool count verification test to prevent this in the future
