## Top Priority Additions (15 extensions)

These should be added immediately as they represent popular, widely-used programming languages:

### Functional Programming (9 extensions)
```
.ex, .exs      # Elixir (Phoenix framework, growing popularity)
.erl, .hrl     # Erlang (distributed systems, telecom)
.hs, .lhs      # Haskell (functional programming)
.clj, .cljs, .cljc  # Clojure (JVM functional language)
.ml, .mli      # OCaml (functional programming)
```

### Scientific & Data (3 extensions)
```
.r, .R         # R language (data science, statistics)
.jl            # Julia (scientific computing, ML)
```

### Scripting (4 extensions)
```
.lua           # Lua (game dev, embedded scripting)
.pl, .pm, .pod # Perl (system admin, text processing)
```

### Modern Systems (4 extensions)
```
.zig           # Zig (modern systems programming)
.nim           # Nim (efficient, expressive)
.cr            # Crystal (Ruby-like, compiled)
.v             # V language (simple, fast)
```

---

## Medium Priority Additions (24 extensions)

### Build Systems (9 extensions)
```
.cmake         # CMake build configuration
.mk, .mak      # Make files
.bazel, .bzl   # Bazel (Google's build tool)
.ninja         # Ninja build system
.sbt           # Scala Build Tool
.podspec       # CocoaPods (iOS)
```

⚠️ **REMOVED**: `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.production` - These contain sensitive credentials and are already properly excluded by the codebase.

### Documentation (5 extensions)
```
.adoc, .asciidoc  # AsciiDoc (technical docs)
.tex, .latex      # LaTeX (academic papers)
.org              # Org-mode (Emacs)
.wiki             # Wiki markup
```

### Web Templates (6 extensions)
```
.hbs, .handlebars  # Handlebars templates
.ejs, .pug, .jade  # Template engines
.jsp               # JavaServer Pages
.erb               # Embedded Ruby
.twig              # Twig (PHP)
```

### Note on Already-Included Extensions
```
.mjs, .cjs     # ES modules, CommonJS (already present in current list)
.groovy        # Groovy (already present in current list)
.rake, .gemspec # Ruby build files (already present in current list)
```

---

## Low Priority / Optional (5 extensions)

Blockchain & specialized languages - add only if targeting these domains:

```
.sol           # Solidity (Ethereum smart contracts)
.move          # Move language (blockchain)
.cairo         # Cairo (StarkNet)
.vhdl, .vhd    # VHDL (hardware description)
```

## Key Findings from Research

### 1. GitHub Linguist is the Gold Standard
- Used by GitHub.com for language detection
- Supports 600+ languages
- Our recommendations align with their "programming" and "markup" categories
- All suggested extensions are in Linguist's database

### 2. AI Coding Assistants Prioritize These Languages
- **Cursor, Copilot, Continue.dev** all support the recommended languages
- LLMs have strong training data for these languages
- Template engines (.erb, .ejs, .hbs) are increasingly important for context

### 3. Build Systems & Config Files Are Critical
- AI assistants need build context for accurate code generation
- Environment files (.env variants) are essential for understanding project setup
- CMake, Bazel, and other build systems are widely used in large projects

### 4. Documentation Formats Matter
- AsciiDoc (.adoc) is popular in technical documentation
- LaTeX (.tex) is standard in academic and technical writing
- Org-mode (.org) is widely used in Emacs community

## What NOT to Add

### Binary Files (Excluded)
```
.pyc, .pyo     # Python bytecode
.class         # Java bytecode
.o, .obj       # Object files
.exe, .dll, .so # Executables
```

### Media Files (Excluded)
```
.png, .jpg, .gif, .svg  # Images
.mp3, .mp4, .wav        # Media
```

### Archives (Excluded)
```
.zip, .tar, .gz  # Compressed files
```

**Reason**: These are binary or non-textual files that cannot be semantically indexed.

## Implementation Recommendation

### Phase 1: Add High Priority (15 extensions)
- Immediate impact
- Covers most popular languages
- Low risk, high reward

### Phase 2: Add Medium Priority (24 extensions)
- Next release
- Improves context quality
- Covers build systems and documentation

### Phase 3: Add Low Priority (5 extensions)
- Based on user demand
- Domain-specific
- Optional

---

## Expected Impact

### Before
- 72 extensions
- Good coverage of mainstream languages
- Missing functional programming, data science, and modern systems languages

### After (Phase 1 + 2)
- 116 extensions
- Comprehensive coverage of all major programming paradigms
- Better context for AI coding assistants
- Competitive with industry-leading code search tools
- Maintains security by excluding sensitive environment files

### Benefits
1. **Broader Language Support**: Covers functional, data science, and modern systems languages
2. **Better AI Context**: More complete project understanding for AI assistants
3. **Industry Alignment**: Matches GitHub Linguist and Sourcegraph standards
4. **Future-Proof**: Includes emerging languages (Zig, Nim, Crystal, V)

## Next Steps

1. Review the detailed analysis in `INDEXABLE_EXTENSIONS_ANALYSIS.md`
2. Decide on implementation phases
3. Update `src/mcp/serviceClient.ts` with selected extensions
4. Test with repositories using the new languages
5. Monitor indexing performance and search quality
6. Update documentation to reflect new language support
