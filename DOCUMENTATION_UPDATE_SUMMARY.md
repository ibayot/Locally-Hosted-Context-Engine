# Documentation Update Summary

## Date: 2025-12-21

## Issue Identified

The Context Engine MCP Server documentation incorrectly stated there were **28 MCP tools** when the actual implementation has **29 tools**.

**Missing Tool**: `execute_plan` - A critical tool for executing implementation plan steps with AI-powered code generation.

## Files Updated

### 1. README.md ✅

**Changes Made**:
- Line 48: Updated header from "28 tools available" to "29 tools available"
- Lines 85-95: Added `execute_plan` tool documentation as tool #14
- Lines 98-160: Renumbered all subsequent tools from 14-28 to 15-29

**New Tool Documentation Added**:
```markdown
14. **`execute_plan(plan, mode?, step_number?, apply_changes?, max_steps?, stop_on_failure?, additional_context?)`** - Execute plan steps with AI-powered code generation
    - `plan`: JSON string of the plan (from create_plan output)
    - `mode` (optional): Execution mode - 'single_step', 'all_ready', or 'full_plan' (default: single_step)
    - `step_number` (optional): Step number to execute (required for single_step mode)
    - `apply_changes` (optional): Apply changes to files (default: false - preview only)
    - `max_steps` (optional): Maximum steps to execute in one call (default: 5)
    - `stop_on_failure` (optional): Stop on first failure (default: true)
    - `additional_context` (optional): Additional context for AI code generation
```

## Tool Count Verification

### Complete Tool List (29 Tools)

**Core Context Tools (6)**: index_workspace, codebase_retrieval, semantic_search, get_file, get_context_for_prompt, enhance_prompt

**Index Management Tools (4)**: index_status, reindex_workspace, clear_index, tool_manifest

**Memory Tools (2)**: add_memory, list_memories

**Planning Tools (4)**: create_plan, refine_plan, visualize_plan, **execute_plan** ← Previously missing from documentation

**Plan Management Tools (13)**: save_plan, load_plan, list_plans, delete_plan, request_approval, respond_approval, start_step, complete_step, fail_step, view_progress, view_history, compare_plan_versions, rollback_plan

**Total: 29 tools** ✅

## Impact

### Before Update
- Documentation claimed 28 tools
- `execute_plan` tool was undocumented
- Promotional materials had incorrect count
- Potential confusion for users looking for execution capabilities

### After Update
- Documentation correctly states 29 tools
- All tools are properly documented
- Promotional materials are accurate
- Users can discover and use the `execute_plan` tool

---

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All documentation and promotional materials have been updated to reflect the correct tool count of 29 MCP tools.
